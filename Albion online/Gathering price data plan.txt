1st: Gather all of the data from the ores every time you want to sell them, just run the application, 
make an app to tell you where best to sell it, maybe where best to sell each one
- You only really want sell_price_min

    1st: request the api for the data
    2nd: scrape the data from website
    3rd: upload to csv or directly make the math
    4th: display in a window the best place to sell everything

    ?: maybe ask the user what items they're selling and tailor the request to it, do it with checkboxes
    





?: Gather the data continually to see market trends and when is the best time to sell each item, 
upload it to a .csv file that you can tailor to your needs
?: Figure out market tax to do the math to resell items if possible, make it warn you if there's a 
cheap item you can buy
?: Scrape inventory straight from client somehow, maybe with the albion data project client
?: Transporter app, make it tell you where to go to sell items, maybe make it tell you where to go to buy items
